This is a concept website that I am making to solidify what I have been learning with React.js
My goal with this is to use the major features of React.js to solidify my understanding and
memory of what I know of React. I also want to explore ways to use my knowledge in a larger scale application.
For instance, I am implementing a light-mode and dark-mode for the website by using a single css file specifying
any dynamic styles. This is referenced through dynamic class naming of tags combined with the tag id.
Some of the things I am focusing on with the site are as follows: Dynamic Styling, using APIs, Database interaction, and easy UX.
